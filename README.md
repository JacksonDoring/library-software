# library-software
Major project for Algorithms and Complexity unit in university. Console software for borrowing DVD's at a library.

What this software demonstrates?

	-Implementation of binary search tree and array data structures
	-Implementation of bubble sort algorithm
	-Implementation of algorithms to search, delete and insert nodes into a binary search tree
	-Implementation of algorithms to search, delete and insert values into an array
	-Implementation of custom algorithm to find the 10 most popular DVD's borrowed by members
	-Use of object orientated programming
	-Knowledge of C#

Sofware Guide:
	-Username and password for the staff account is "today123" and "password" respectively
	-Usernames for members are a combination of their first and last name, for example if the first and last name was John Smith, than the username would be JohnSmith
